   Description: 

   - This code demonstrates an elaborate and complex implementation of a video game, 
     where a player can navigate a maze, encounter enemies and collect power-ups.

   - The game uses various object-oriented programming concepts, such as classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

   - Please note that this is a simplified implementation meant to showcase the complexity of the code.
     A production-level game would have many more features, optimizations, and assets.

   - This code contains more than 200 lines of code.
